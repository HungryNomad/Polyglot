## Method Info

### Pronunciation and Listening
For me pronunciation and listening are definitely top priority. Neutralize your accent right from the start and also be able to hear the sounds that others are making. Learning IPA doesn't sound fun, but it will be a useful tool.

### Conversations with native speakers
Actually speaking to people is next on the list. Mimic Method covers this as step 2 as well. Benny Lewis reccomends to start here.

- Talk from day 1 https://www.fluentin3months.com/tedx/
- Perfecting your introuction script https://www.mimicmethod.com/italian-in-2-months-day-28/
- Writing corrections http://lang-8.com/
- Find people to talk to https://www.mimicmethod.com/italian-in-2-months-day-35/
- Listen to real speakers 1 http://forvo.com
- Listen to real speakers 2 http://rhinospike.com/
- Learn Language through music https://lyricstraining.com/

### Top X words and phrases
Concurrent training with the above listening and speaking. Speaking without sufficient vocab is difficult. Incorporating top phrases with SRS is ideal. Also if possible, make these lists audio only. You can do this training on the go, in the car, on the way to work, coffee break at work...

- Anki Audio decks!

### Reading
Last resort for beginners, but OK to learn after you've gotten far enough in verbal communication

- Lmited vocabulary books that slowly introduce words as you go along
- Read both langages at the same time http://www.beelinguapp.com/
- Read your favorite book in your target language
